		<p>My name is Ben. I'm an engineer-turned-IT professional who is looking to expand my skillset. I graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a degree in mechanical engineering. After a few years of working, I decided to change my career path and goals and got a job doing IT things ranging from help desk to configuring networking switches and servers.</p>

		<p>My main hobbies are PC gaming, board gaming, and riding roller coasters. Click one of the links below to view some of my favorites of each of these.</p>
