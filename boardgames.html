		Twilight Imperium: 4th Edition is my favorite board game. It involves exploration, conquest, politics, and trade all wrapped into one massive experience that can last a full day.<br><br>

		<p id="tmars"><img src=".\img\boardgames\tmars.jpg" alt="Terraforming Mars">
		Terraforming Mars is a great science-themed game about terraforming Mars (obviously). Your goal, along with the other players, is to raise the planet's temperature, oxygen level, and water content to earth-like levels while building your personal corporation to be the most prestigious and profitable.<br><br>

		<p id="gaia"><img src=".\img\boardgames\gaia.png" alt="Gaia Project">
		Gaia Project is a recent favorite of mine. In this game, you compete against the other players to spread your race across the galaxy and form massive federations as fast as possible. To do this you must construct buildings to generate resources and money while researching advanced technologies to gain an edge over your opponents.<br><br>
